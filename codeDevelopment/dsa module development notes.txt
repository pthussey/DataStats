* Edit my alternative hypothesis resampling functions to remove the part about doubling
  - Can only calculate onesided for values more extreme than the provided null hypothesis test stat

* Check again how my power tests handle the alternative cases
  - Don't they have both one and two-sided?

* Change my power tests to actually use my hypothesis test classes
  - Could the power tests be added to the hypothesis tests as a class method? - yes
    Is it even possible to call a class within itself? - yes
  - Still need to figure out how to deal with the onsided parameter
    This can probably be addressed using an if statement
  - Also still need to create a superclass method placeholder
  - Also need to test the test_stat thing
  - Could also try this a different way as below:  
    Probably don't have to call the class within itself, just the functions like ComputeRv
    The power test method would have to do the first part of simulating resampling from the population, 
    and then run the hypothesis test.
    This would then need to be repeated to calculate power of the test.

* I think I should just get rid of my alternative hypothesis and power tests.
  - These just complicate things and are really overkill
  - But what about the one-sample mean case?
    I don't think there is a way to do this one other than alternative

* Need to also consider whether or not my original resampling functions should really return a test_stat.
  - It doesn't seem like it really is a test_stat in the alternative hypothesis case
  - It is actually just the original data statistic
  - Is this really needed?
