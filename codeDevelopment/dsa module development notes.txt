* Edit my alternative hypothesis resampling functions to remove the part about doubling
  - Can only calculate onesided for values more extreme than the provided null hypothesis test stat

* Could the tail parameter be removed and instead be inferred somehow instead in my hypothesis tests?
  - Maybe could use the location of the average of the sampling disribution in comparison to the test stat?

* Change my power tests to actually use my hypothesis test classes
  - Could the power tests be added to the hypothesis tests as a class method? - yes
    Is it even possible to call a class within itself? - yes
  - Still need to figure out how to deal with the onsided parameter
    This can probably be addressed using an if statement - done
  - Also still need to create a superclass method placeholder - done
  - Check that attributes like test_stat and rv do not change after running Power() method - done
  - Write up documentation for the classes including lists of attributes and methods
  - Include some documentation in class methods too, especially the Power() method
  - Mention in superclass documentation that it is not meant to be used, must use subclasses - done
  - Could also try this a different way as below:  
    Probably don't have to call the class within itself, just the functions like ComputeRv
    The power test method would have to do the first part of simulating resampling from the population, 
    and then run the hypothesis test.
    This would then need to be repeated to calculate power of the test.

* I think I can just get rid of my resampling functions too - done
  - I decided to just provide the sampling distribution as a hypothesis test class attribute
  - Then it is available if ever needed for some reason
  - Doubtful it will be needed though since the rv has so many useful attributes and methods

* Should I mark some of my hypothesis test functions as private (single underbar in front)?

* I think I should just get rid of my alternative hypothesis and power tests.
  - These just complicate things and are really overkill
  - But what about the one-sample mean case?
    I don't think there is a way to do this one other than alternative
