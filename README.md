# DataStatsAnalysis
 A statistics module containing useful functions and classes I am writing while going through the ThinkStats book.

I am writing this dataStatsAnaylsis.py module because I want to have a tool box of data analysis / statistical functions to use in my work after finishing the ThinkStats book.

I chose to do this rather than just use the classes and functions supplied in the book because going through this exercise has proven to be a great way to learn the material more deeply. Also it means I don't need to be dependent on using the code the book supplies, and I can continue building new functionality as I need it.
