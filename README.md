# DataStatsModule
 A statistics module containing useful functions I wrote while going through the ThinkStats book.

I wrote the functions in the dataStatsAnaylsis.py module because I wanted to have a tool box of data analysis / statistical functions to use in my work after finishing the ThinkStats book.

I chose to do this rather than just use the classes and functions supplied in the book because I want to use methods the methods scipy.stats / statsmodels directly and also use methods that do not depend on the book's classes and objects.
