# DataStatsAnalysis
This module serves as a tool box of useful functions and classes for statistical data analysis in Python. Most of the functions and classes use non-parametric computational methods, such as resampling and permutation, rather than analytical methods.

I think the hypothesis test classes I have built in this module are particulaly useful, as they not only compute p-values but can also compute the statistical power of the test being used.

I started creating this module while studying Alan Downey's ThinkStats book, so much of it is inspired by and based on code from this book. However I chose to build my own functions and classes rather than just use those supplied in the book because going through this process has proven to be a great way to learn the material more deeply. Also it means I don't need to be dependent on using the code the book supplies, and I can continue building new functionality as I need it.
